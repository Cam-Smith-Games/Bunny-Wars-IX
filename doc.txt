TO DO:
when player dies, coins set to 0...
	make coins quickly decrement and add sound effect so players all like "nooo...my coinnnsss!"
fix keys...laptop only pressing 2 buttons at a time for some reason (non-mechanical keyboards?)
decoration (trees, fountains, flowers, etc... uncollidable tiles)
bg music
ball form cooldown (with visual of some sort (cooldown bar))
zombie chat bubbles ('brainz....')



controls:
	up = jump/doublejump/walljump 
	left/right = move
	down = spectral slam
	shift = dash
	space = ball of doom




ground pound attack
 - sonic ball attack
 will need 3 animations
 	1. transitioning into ball form
 	2. ball form (really fast animation speed, maybe also add more frames by rotating in photoshop)
 	3. transitioning out of ball form

 	space pressed, transition into ball form, animation done, set ball form to true
 	while ball form true, just spin, maybe do something to gravity idk
 	player hurts enemies and isnt hurt by enemies while in ball form, and bounces off of enemies

teleport attack
need 2 animations
	1. hovering above
	2. landing on ground

	player presses shift mid-air
	set hover to true, set timer...hovers for a second (first animation) 
		ALL MOVEMENT PREVENTED WHILE HOVERING
	timer done, set hover to false, teleport down to ground

	any enemy passed through was damaged 
	(checking collision with enemy, if collided while teleporting, damage it)
	different sound effects depending on whether enemy was hit or not?
